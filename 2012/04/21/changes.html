All of that is about to change, I&#39;m leaving web development for a new role that I feel embraces all of things that I like about web development but allows me to break outside of the browser. Anyone who knows me knows of my passion for new technology and gadgets. What most people don&#39;t know is I&#39;m a closet project management and process engineering geek. I love seeing a new projects evolve, I enjoy helping organizations and people tackle difficult technology and process issues.​ That said, Starting in June I&#39;ll be returning to my Alma-mater UW-Whitewater. ​What that means for this site is that while my day job may not fall in web, I&#39;ll never completely give up web development. My plan is to turning this into a place to talk about Titanium Mobile and SASS/Compass. My real goal is to finally start contributing back to a community that I&#39;ve gotten so much from over the years. Choosing a project or two that have really made a difference in my career.</p></article><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/jquery.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=/js/script.d16b.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
